    <h2 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-800 mb-2">Your Choices, Your Collection</h2>
    <p class="text-base/loose font-bold text-gray-600 mb-2">With every discovery choose to “collect,” “drop,” or controversially “destroy” artworks. Collected pieces enrich your virtual gallery, available for trade or curation. Dropping an artwork passes the opportunity to others, but choosing to destroy it removes the piece from the game forever.</p>
